# Overview
As an LIS student, I’m interested in understanding how well-compensated the role of a librarian is, particularly in academic libraries. I will conduct state-level and institution-level analyses to assess librarian salary levels, comparing them to other professions and regional living costs. This project aims to provide insight into the financial prospects of academic librarianship. 

# Research Questions
I’m interested in exploring the following questions but may not be able to answer all of them within the project’s scope.
- Which states offer the highest salaries for librarians?
- Which academic institutions offer the highest salaries for librarians?
- What factors might have influenced librarian salaries, such as state, institution size, library size, and regional cost of living?
- How do librarian salaries compare to those of other faculty and staff within academic institutions?
- How do librarian salaries compare to the average regional salary or other occupations at similar education and experience levels?
- Which states provide the best salary-to-living-cost ratio for librarians?

# Team
This is a one-person team. Wanheng will be responsible for data acquisition, integration, profiling, quality assessment, cleaning, analysis and visualization, workflow automation, reproducible packaging, citation, metadata creation, archiving, and obtaining persistent identifier.

# Datasets
1. Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) <br>
Data on Academic Libraries <br>
https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/datacenter/SelectVariables.aspx?stepId=1&sid=1f7ec561-a803-4ea6-8163-3761c55f451f&rtid=5 <br>
This link allows to select variables and customize datasets. <br>
I'm interested in the number of library staff and libary expenditures on salary/wages (compared to total expeditures) in each academic library. <br>
I may also compare librarian salaries to other faculty and staff. <br>
I'm also thinking about mapping academic libraries to a US map and using color coding to represent either salary levels or the salary-to-living-cost ratio. <br>
