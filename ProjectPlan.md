# Overview
As an LIS student, I’m interested in understanding how well-compensated the role of a librarian is, particularly in academic libraries.I will conduct state-level and institutional analyses to assess librarian salary levels, comparing them to other professions and regional living costs. This project aims to provide insight into the financial prospects of academic librarianship. 

# Research Questions
I’m interested in exploring the following questions but may not be able to answer all of them within the project’s scope.
- Which states offer the highest salaries for librarians?
- Which academic institutions offer the highest salaries for librarians?
- What factors might have influenced librarian salaries, such as state, institution size, library size, and regional cost of living?
- How do librarian salaries compare to those of other faculty and staff within academic institutions?
- How do librarian salaries compare to the average regional salary or other occupations at similar education and experience levels?
- Which states provide the best salary-to-living-cost ratio for librarians?

# Datasets
1. Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) 
Data on Academic Libraries
https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/datacenter/SelectVariables.aspx?stepId=1&sid=1f7ec561-a803-4ea6-8163-3761c55f451f&rtid=5
This link allows to select variables and customize datasets. 
I'm interested in the number of library staff and libary expenditures on salary/wages (compared to total expeditures) in each academic library. 
I may also compare librarian salaries to other faculty and staff.
I'm also thinking about mapping academic libraries to a US map and using color coding to represent either salary levels or the salary-to-living-cost ratio.
