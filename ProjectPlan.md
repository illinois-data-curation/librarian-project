# Overview
As an LIS student, I’m interested in understanding how well-compensated the role of a librarian is, particularly in academic libraries. This project will involve both state-level and institution-level analyses to evaluate librarian salaries, exploring how they compare to other professions and align with regional living costs. By investigating these factors, this project aims to offer a clearer picture of the financial prospects in academic librarianship, providing valuable insights for those considering or currently pursuing careers in this field.

# Research Questions
I’m interested in exploring the following questions but may not be able to answer all of them within the project’s scope.
- Which states offer the highest salaries for librarians?
- Which academic institutions offer the highest salaries for librarians?
- What factors might have influenced librarian salaries, such as state, institution size, library size, and regional cost of living?
- How do librarian salaries compare to those of other faculty and staff within academic institutions?
- How do librarian salaries compare to the average regional salary or other occupations at similar education and experience levels?
- Which states provide the best salary-to-living-cost ratio for librarians?

# Datasets
1. **Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS)** <br>
**Data on Academic Libraries**: https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/datacenter/SelectVariables.aspx?stepId=1&sid=1f7ec561-a803-4ea6-8163-3761c55f451f&rtid=5 <br>
This link allows to select variables and customize datasets. <br>
I'm interested in the number of library staff and libary expenditures on salary/wages (compared to total expeditures) in each academic library. <br>
I may also compare librarian salaries to other faculty and staff. <br>
I'm also thinking about mapping academic libraries to a US map and using color coding to represent either salary levels or the salary-to-living-cost ratio. <br>
